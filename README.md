Dapr is a portable, event-driven, serverless runtime for building distributed applications across cloud and edge.

## Alpha

This SDK is currently in Alpha. Work is underway to bring forward a stable
release and will likely involve breaking changes.
- Documentation is incomplete.
- Not all building blocks are currently implemented.
- There may be bugs.
- The SDK does not have complete test coverage.

The maintainers commit to resolving any issues that arise and bringing this SDK
to a stable release. With this in mind, the SDK will follow the norms and
conventions of a stable SDK so far as is possible.

This SDK will be accounted for as a part of the release process. Support for 
the latest runtime release is targeted but not guaranteed.

The main tenet of development will be stability and functionality that improves
resiliency.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Rust version 1.56 or higher installed. If not, install Rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

You will also need to install [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protobuf-compiler-installation).

## How to use

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
dapr = "0.13.0"
```

Here's a basic example to create a client:

```rust
use dapr;

async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Get the Dapr port and create a connection
    let port: u16 = std::env::var("DAPR_GRPC_PORT")?.parse()?;
    let addr = format!("https://127.0.0.1:{}", port);

    // Create the client
    let mut client = dapr::Client::<dapr::client::TonicClient>::connect(addr).await?;
```

## Building

To build the SDK run:

```bash
cargo build
```

>Note: The protobuf client generation is built into `cargo build` process so updating the proto files under `dapr/` is enough to update the protobuf client.

## Updating .proto files from upstream Dapr

To fetch the latest .proto files from Dapr execute the script `update-protos.sh`:

```bash
./update-protos.sh
```

By default, the script fetches the latest proto updates from the master branch of the Dapr repository. If you need to choose a specific release or version, use the -v flag:

```bash
./update-protos.sh -v v1.12.0
```
